Crawling around [Cheat-Sheats.org](http://cheat-sheets.org/) today I found a great Python reference cheat sheat by [Richard Gruet](http://rgruet.free.fr/). This is a good addition to the original [Python Documentation](http://minuteware.net/python-quick-reference/Python%20Documentation) as it provides a brief overview of Python basics.

Theyâ€™ve got a [web version](http://rgruet.free.fr/PQR27/PQR2.7.html), as well as a [printable PDF](http://rgruet.free.fr/PQR27/PQR2.7_printing_a4.pdf)
